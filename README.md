# BIOCOMPUTING

Vera Pandeâ€™s GitHub repository for **Cluster Computing for Biology (APSC 460, Fall 2025, William & Mary)**.

This repository contains all of my work that I am doing for *Cluster Computing for Biology*, focused on **shell fluency**, **HPC environments**, and **computational reproducibility**.
